## About

> A proposed university-affiliated organization for the preservation and study of the historical multiplayer game Decwar, designed to work toward the shared goal of promoting the history of computing and digital culture.

Ongoing collaboration between faculty, alumni, and archival specialists, providing a permanent institutional home for Decwar research, preservation, and historical reconstruction.

**Code Restoration** Oversee the technical work focused on restoring the original Decwar codebase (written in Fortran and Assembly) and stabilizing the build process to ensure authentic binaries can run in historically faithful environments.

**Artifact Housing** Work closely with the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History to acquire and house physical artifacts.

**Monograph Support** Officially support the development of the proposed monograph, Decwar: A Galaxy in the Machine Room.

**Cultural History** Research how the UT Computation Center served as a "proto-online social world," documenting the embodied computing culture, social norms, and community standards that formed around Decwar.

**Experiential Learning** Utilize the preserved and implemented code in educational settings, such as coding classes and installations classes, to build modern implementations and comparative exhibits.

**Oral History Collection** Conduct and archive oral histories with Decwar's original authors, players, system operators, and lab administrators to document the "lived experience" and cultural significance of the game.

**Installation Development** Design and construct exhibits aimed at communicating the "secret history" of Decwar and recreating the authentic sensory environment of the 1970s machine room.

> A brief history of the UT Star Trek games, from 1973 to 1982.

**1971 [Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(1971_video_game))** Basic single-player on UCal Irvine SDS Sigma 7, Mike Mayfield. Then in his final year of high school, Mike frequented a computer lab at the University of California, Irvine, while teaching himself how to program. The lab operated both an SDS Sigma 7 and a DEC PDP-10. The PDP-10 hosted a version of the 1962 PDP-1 game **[Spacewar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!)**. Mayfield had gained illicit access to the Sigma 7 at the lab and wanted to create his own version of the game for the system. Spacewar required a vector graphics display, however, and the Sigma 7 only had access to a non-graphical Model 33 ASR Teletype. Mike also did a 1972 rewrite of the original in Basic for the HP 2000C at the HP office near UCal Irvine.

**1973 [UT Trek](https://gitlab.com/esr/super-star-trek)** Basic single-player on UT Austin CDC 6600, Grady Hicks and Jim Korp.

**1974 [UT Fortran](https://gitlab.com/esr/super-star-trek)** aka **Super Star Trek** Fortran single-player on UT Austin CDC 6600, Dave Matuszek and Paul Reynolds.

**1976 UT War** Fortran two-player on UT Austin CDC 6600, author unknown, rewritten by Robert Schneider.

**1978 [UT Decwar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decwar)** Assembly and Fortran eighteen-player on UT Austin PDP-10, Bob Hysick and Jeff Potter. Version 1.0 of Decwar was released in August 1978. The university would make copies available on tape for the nominal fee of $50, and it soon appeared on PDP-10s around the world. The greatly updated 2.0 was released in July 1979, and another major version, 2.3, on 20 November 1981.
